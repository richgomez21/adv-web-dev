    <!-- The Vue app will get 'mounted' into this div -->
    <div id="app"></div>

    <!-- imports the Vue library -->
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@next"></script>
    <!-- Make sure to include Vue before main.js, this file will contain our JS code-->
    <script src="main.js"></script>

    <p>
        This is how I originally went about building the User Manager.
        I thought it made sense to pass the selected user as a prop to UserForm rather
        than the selectedUserId.
        As I was going down this rabit hole, it led me to break a basic rule of Vue,
        which is <b>never mutate a prop</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        We could try to avoid breaking this rule by making a copy of
        of the prop, and storing the property as a data member.
        this will require use to rename the prop to 'initialUser' instead of 'user'
        (we'll also have to update the template in the root component).
        This is actually a solution that is recommended in Vue. For more details,
        checkout <a href="https://vuejs.org/guide/components/props.html#one-way-data-flow">this link</a>.
        But note that it defaults to showing the code samples using the 'composition api', and
        we are using the 'options api'. So you can press a toggle switch at the top left of the page to show the 
        code samples using the options api.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's try to follow the suggestion and see if we can get the app to work.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you do some googling, you'll find lots of articles about how mutating a prop is an 'anti-pattern'
        in Vue. Unfortunately, I did not find an article that didn't use NPM for Vue.
        We'll get to that soon!
