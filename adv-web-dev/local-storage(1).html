		Browsers have a very simple database built into them.
		It's not a relational database, rather a key/value database
		(Databases that are not relational are known as No-SQL databases)
		
		Here's an example of a key/value database:
		
		KEY 			Value
		---------------------------
		firstName 		"Bob"
		lastName 		"Smith"
		age 			"7"
		cats 			"['Bunny', 'Fanny', 'Willis']"
		dogs 			"[{name:'Brutus', age:7},{name:'Marty', age:2}]"

		The key serves as an identifier for the data stored in the value
		So if you were to get value of the 'lastName' key, you would get "Smith".
		If you were to get the value of the 'age' key, you would get "7"
		(Remember that both the keys and the values are strings)

		The last to keys (cats and dogs) are storing strings, but we can use the JSON
		API to convert them to arrays. So although key/value database seem very simple,
		and not super useful on the surface, they are actually very powerful because
		they can store JSON strings. 
		
		Your browser can create a key/value database for each domain that you visit
		So if you visit a page www.example.com and the JavaScript in it stores data in localStorage,
		then the data will be available to any page that you visit on the www.example.com server. 


		The localStorage object has a pretty simple API:

		setItem(key, value)			sets a key/value pair
		getItem(key)				returns the value for a key
		key(index)					returns the key name at the specified index
		clear()						Clears all key/value pairs from the database
		*/


		// STEP 1 - Putting Data into the localStorage database
		// Let's go ahead create a key/value database like the one in the diagram
		




		// Now open the developer tools in the browser and look in the Applications tab.
		// You'll see the key/value databases that have been created on the left
		// Click on the one for localhost (or maybe file://)
		// You should see the key/value pairs that we added.


		// You can comment out the lines of code above, since the data is now in the browsers localStorage
		

		// STEP 2 - Retrieving Data from localStorage
		// Let's retreive all the key/value pairs from the database
		



		// Step 3 -  Clearing localStorage


		
		// Limitations of Local Storage:
		// 	You can only key/value pairs as strings 
		// 	If a user clears the browsing data, the local storage will be removed. 
		// 	Max capacity is 5mb. 
		// 	Is not cross-device, if a user entered in a value on their computer, then went to the site on their phone, their values would not be shown on the phone.
		
		
		

		// Step 4 - Practice storing and retreiving JSON strings in localStorage
		// JSON allows you to encode complex javascript arrays and objects as strings
		// So, we can 'stringify' an object or array and then store it as the value in a key/value database
		const users = [
			{id: 7, firstName:"Bob", lastName:"Smith", email:"bob@smith.com", password:"test", roleId:1, active: true},
			{id: 96, firstName:"Betty", lastName:"Smith", email:"betty@smith.com", password:"test", roleId:2, active: true},
			{id: 33, firstName:"Barney", lastName:"Smith", email:"barney@smith.com", password:"test", roleId:1, active: false}
		];




		// Create a getAllUsers() function

		// Create a getUserById(id) function
